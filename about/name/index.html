<p>A unique name isnt it ? But how did it come that way ?</p>
<p>Well the word Book was in there since the beginning. My first online representation was made by me together with my parents
and I didnt really just wanted to use my full name, but rather I wanted to use something interesting. And as my main hobby during that time was reading and
I wanted something that was cool (english words where cool at the time) so I used Book and my Firstname.</p>
<p>However during the time after I was really into Minecraft and loved watching it/wanted to make my own channel.
That was the reason I renamed most of my stuff to Bookcrafter_LP. I know how cringy that was but it was mainly a phase.
At some point while watching a stream a streamer called my name out, and since I agreed to not liking it at the time I ended up
making a new online persona. Also I had just watched one of the lotr movies.</p>
<h2 id="book-reference-to-my-hobby-and-old-persona--lordofthe-lotr-reference--dings-german-word-for-thing-and-also-very-similar-to-rings">Book (Reference to my hobby and old persona) + lordofthe (lotr reference) + dings (german word for &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and also very similar to rings)</h2>
<p>So I had my unique and non cringe name, but how did I come up with the Lybry part that I often use ?</p>
<p>This was due to a limitation with the name system on switch. &ldquo;Booklordofthedings&rdquo; was way too long and Book wasnt interesting enough for
me, so I used lbry.Book (similar to pkmn on pokemon cards, but with library). But since I was playing brawlhalla at the time I often ended up changing my name and because of a spelling error
on my side I ended up with lybry.book wich I liked enough to just keep it. Now alot of things that have to do with me use lybry as a name.</p>
