      <description>Booklordofthedings A unique name isnt it ? But how did it come that way ?
Well the word Book was in there since the beginning. My first online representation was made by me together with my parents and I didnt really just wanted to use my full name, but rather I wanted to use something interesting. And as my main hobby during that time was reading and I wanted something that was cool (english words where cool at the time) so I used Book and my Firstname.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Let the links commence&amp;rdquo; But seriously this is the page where everything is linked
The Lybry: The website you are on right now, a Hub for all of my shenanigans. Like a blog and a gallery.
Twitter: My probably most commonly used social media rn. Tweets about everything.
Youtube: I usually do streams here or more analytical stuff.
Github: The place where I store all of my projects and also this website is hosted.</description>

      <description>So, about me.
Im a 18 year old student living in germany
People usually refer to me as &amp;ldquo;Booklordofthedings&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Book&amp;rdquo; (he/him)
I am very interested in alot of computer science topics and &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; how to program in C#, node js and in Beeflang
There are alot of games and franchises I like, although I dont usually interact with the fandom. Most of them tend to be indie games, although I also like stuff like Plants vs Zombies, Paladins or Pokemon Since I call myself &amp;ldquo;Book&amp;quot;lordofthedings it would be weird if I wouldnt read.</description>
