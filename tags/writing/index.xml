      <description>My main knowledge of the english language comes from the internet and not from school.
This is probably a fairly common for people that have english as their secondary language nowadays, however for me there is the additional problem of actually learning almost nothing during english class.
My teacher was horrible at teaching and basically the entire class agreed to it, so my writing suffered.
After basically being adicted to watching yt and at some point switching to watching it mainly in english, my level of english started to improve, with a big focus there being spoken english.</description>
