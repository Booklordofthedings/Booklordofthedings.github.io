      <description>Today I started the drawabox course. If you are wondering what it is, its
a drawing course that is intended to show people
an organized way to learn how to draw.
https://drawabox.com/
And since I never really learned to draw I decided to start the course for myself, with the goal of doing 2 pages of it a day and hopefully being a better artist at the end of this.</description>
