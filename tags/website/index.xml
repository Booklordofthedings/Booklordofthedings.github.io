      <description>I finallly &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; my website I dont think I will ever truly finish it, as even with this setup right now I am immideatly thinking about making a custom static page generator
The Idea I always really liked the idea of having a website/blog where I can post my own stuff, while not being limited by lenght like on twitter, but also by being more open than a private discord server.</description>
