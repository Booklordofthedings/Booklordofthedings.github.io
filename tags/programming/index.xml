      <description>I actually finished a game at some point My original goal since elementary school always was, to become a game programmer, and while currently the focus changed quite a bit to general programming with gamedev as a sidehobby I did learn alot of game programming and in the summer of 2020 I actually finished my first game project for a GameJam.
(A gamejam is a time limited game making &amp;ldquo;competition&amp;rdquo; where the participants make a game based on a certain theme)</description>
