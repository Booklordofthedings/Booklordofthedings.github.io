      <description>My main knowledge of the english language comes from the internet and not from school.
This is probably a fairly common for people that have english as their secondary language nowadays, however for me there is the additional problem of actually learning almost nothing during english class.
My teacher was horrible at teaching and basically the entire class agreed to it, so my writing suffered.
After basically being adicted to watching yt and at some point switching to watching it mainly in english, my level of english started to improve, with a big focus there being spoken english.</description>

      <description>Today I started the drawabox course. If you are wondering what it is, its
a drawing course that is intended to show people
an organized way to learn how to draw.
https://drawabox.com/
And since I never really learned to draw I decided to start the course for myself, with the goal of doing 2 pages of it a day and hopefully being a better artist at the end of this.</description>
