           <h1>Learning Sdl2 in beef 1: Making a window</h1>
           <pre class="removepre">
This is basically going to be a text mirror of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiJ0WE4NZ3NYJy0aROLLe_12ayGUXCafV">Youtube series</a>.
The series is just translating the <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php">lazyfoo tutorial</a> into the beef language, but I feel, like there could still be something
someone can learn from this. Some Beeflang and the tools necessary to make a 2d game in sdl2.

While SDl2 is technically platform indipendent this guide will still mainly focus on windows, as we will be relying on the ide.

    Initial setup:
            Install <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/">Beef</a>. You should probably install the nightly, as beef currently doesnt have a 1.0 version, so it wont be guaranteed stable anyways.
            (Unstable nightlys will be generally fixed on the next nightly.)

            Create a new Project workspace (File -> new -> workspace -> empty project)
            Rightly on the workspace tab and choose add from installed and add SDL2 from the list that shows up
            Create a "Program" class in your project workspace
            Add a Main class to the Program class:
            <pre>
                <code class="language-csharp">
namespace yourProgram
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {

        }
    }
}
                </code>
             </pre>
In order to actually be able to use SDL functions we need to include it now.
There are two things that need to be given in order for this to be the case. First you have to rightclick on the project -> properties -> dependencies -> check the box that says SDL2
Now you need to add "using SDL2" to the top of your program, like how you would import stuff in other languages like C#.

When creating a window there are 3 things we should know, that being, the width, height and the name that we want to give our window.
Since we might need to know these variables elsewhere we can declare them in a <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/docs/language-guide/datatypes/globals/">global scope</a>, so that we always have acess to them if we need them.
The given datatype is int32;
We are just going to call the variables game_width and game_height


<h3>This is how your program should look now (or atleast similar):</h3>
<pre>
    <code class="language-csharp">
using SDL2;
namespace yourProgram
{
    static
    {
       public const int32 game_width = 640;
       public const int32 game_height = 360;
           // Because these are declared in the global scope we can acess them wherever we want.
    }
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {

        }
    }
}
    </code>
 </pre>
Now we can intialize sdl with a simple function in Main.
<pre>
<code class="language-csharp">
SDL.Init(.Video);
</code>
</pre>
After initializing sdl with the video module we can create our window
<pre>
    <code class="language-csharp">
//First one is the name, second and third one is the location where it spawns and the other two are widht and height. Shown makes sure that it shows up on creation
SDL.Window* window = SDL.CreateWindow("Window Name goes here", .Centered, .Centered, game_width, game_height, .Shown);
    </code>
    </pre>
Now in order to draw something on this (In our case a solid color) we need to get the surface object of the window.
<pre>
    <code class="language-csharp">
SDL.Surface* ScreenSurface = SDL.GetWindowSurface(window);
    </code>
    </pre>
Specify a Fill color
<pre>
    <code class="language-csharp">
SDL.FillRect(ScreenSurface, null, SDL.MapRGB(ScreenSurface.format, 0xFF,0x00,0x00));
    </code>
    </pre>
The "null" indicates that we want to fill the entire surface instead of only a part of it.
Now we have to update the Surface,
Set a delay, so the program doesnt immideatly close
and clear everything out, so that we dont have any memory leaks.
<pre>
    <code class="language-csharp">
SDL.UpdateWindowSurface(Window);

SDL.Delay(5000);

SDL.DestroyWindow(window);
SDL.Quit();
    </code>
    </pre>

If you now run this program (f5 or select debug -> start debugging)
you should see a red window pop up. If you tweak the hex values input in the MapRGB function you will get other results, and if you create an SDL.Rect to put into the second
FillRect parameter you should be able to only color a part of the window.
           </pre>
